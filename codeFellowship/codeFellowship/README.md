The app is called CodeFellowship and lets users create an account and log in.
To create an account, users have to provide their username, password, first name, last name, date of birth, and a short bio.
Users' passwords are encrypted for security.
Once users have an account, they can log in and see their username displayed on every page.
The app has a homepage that shows basic information about CodeFellowship.
If users aren't logged in, they can see links to log in or create an account.
If users are logged in, they can see a link to log out.
When users create an account, they're automatically logged in.

The  feature task giving me an issue is the CSS file not being read. (I unhooked it and reworked my html since so the value dont match now)
