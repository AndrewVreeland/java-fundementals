The app is called CodeFellowship and lets users create an account and log in.
To create an account, users have to provide their username, password, first name, last name, date of birth, and a short bio.
Users' passwords are encrypted for security.
Once users have an account, they can log in and see their username displayed on every page.
The app has a homepage that shows basic information about CodeFellowship.
If users aren't logged in, they can see links to log in or create an account.
If users are logged in, they can see a link to log out.
When users create an account, they're automatically logged in.

The two feature tasks giving me issues are the CSS and user data coming in as null. 
the data shows properly within SQL and the data is formatted the same as the username, so I am not sure where the disconnect is.
